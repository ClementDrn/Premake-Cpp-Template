Clone the projet but do not forget to include submodules with `--recursive`.

```bash
git clone --recursive PROJECT_URL
```

### Windows

Generate the projects, by executing the script that corresponds to your platform under the `Scripts/` directory.

Now build and run the generated Visual Studio solution `Sudoku.sln`. You should see the application running.
